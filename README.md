## Midterm FIP
This is going to be a rough sketch website build for the FIP.
Most of the contents are yet to be added and this website is not the final version of the FIP. Here I've chose Billy Beer as the main topic. I've addeda navigation menu which is responsive in both tablet and desktop. I've added a main hero imrage which I plan on creating a SVG (with animation) and also there are two promotional images. Here I tried adding images infront of the text but faced some erros which I will try to improve further. Here you could also find the sale page with similar contents and I am still unsure about the footer section so I haven't made any chnages to that. I've added a basic hover animation in the sale (buy now) part and rounded the sale section images. All the ALT and HREF tags are empty (#) because the content is yet not decided. This website could be considered a rough sketch of how the final website will look like.
